Filebuffer can map files into memory. This is often faster than using the
primitives in `std::io`, and also more convenient. Furthermore this crate
offers prefetching and checking whether file data is resident in physical
memory (so access will not incur a page fault). This enables non-blocking
file reading.

Example
-------
Below is an implementation of the `sha256sum` program that is both faster and
simpler than the naive `std::io` equivalent. (See `sha256sum_filebuffer` and
`sha256sum_naive` in the examples directory.)

```rust
use std::env;
use crypto::digest::Digest;
use crypto::sha2::Sha256;
use filebuffer::FileBuffer;

extern crate crypto;
extern crate filebuffer;

fn main() {
    for fname in env::args().skip(1) {
        let fbuffer = FileBuffer::open(&fname).expect("failed to open file");
        let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
        hasher.input(&fbuffer);
        println!("{}  {}", hasher.result_str(), fname);
    }
}
```
